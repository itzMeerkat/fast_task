# Fast Task
For people who want to be organized to be more organized, and show off how organized they are to their boss to secure working credits you deserve.

## How fast
### Add new task
* Less than 1s to open the app
* Type, optionally select deadline and priority as desired, let's say 5s.
* Click on "Add task" button, less than 1s.
Total is around 7s.

### Record progress
If you are done for today's work and want to record your progress, click on "Record today's work".
It will take you to a bunch of cards and you can choose time spent for each on-going task, that will take you around 1s per task.


So say you are woking as an engineer, according to my experience, the total amonut of time you spend on this app won't be much longer than 1 min everyday to keep all your tasks tracked and ready to show off to others in any time.


## Honest Gantt Chart (the showing off part)
We all know how much flexibility there is in traditional gantt chart. You might pause when a task is officially "on-going", or simply working on tons of tasks a bit everyday. Traditional Gantt Chart just won't care.
So I make each day in the chart have a variable height, representing how many time you spent.

## Data security
This application is 100% local. It stores your task and progress in a local sqlite database.
At this point, the database is not encrypted nor protected by any mean. Let me know if you have such needs.
